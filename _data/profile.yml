  <p>
    I’m an interdisciplinary researcher interested in applying data science and computational methods to understand digital consumer behavior, market dynamics, and business decision-making.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s in Communication Data Science at the University of Southern California, expected to graduate in December 2025. I hold dual bachelor’s degrees in Sociology and Social Science (Economics), and my recent research on game behavior and social influence has been accepted by ICA and AEJMC.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have interned in market research and investment analysis, with experience in Python, SQL, and machine learning tools. I am now seeking Ph.D. opportunities or full-time roles in marketing, business analytics, or strategy. If you’re open to collaboration or opportunities, feel free to reach out.
